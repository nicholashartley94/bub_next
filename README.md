This is a starter we use for Patronage Next.JS projects for client sites.

It is setup as a GitHub template install, so that it can be easily duplicated to new projects.

Changes from standard Next:

- Adding a Layout file and global SCSS for sitewide styles
- React Helmet for global and per page meta tags
- Configuration with eslint and prettier for JavaScript formatting.
